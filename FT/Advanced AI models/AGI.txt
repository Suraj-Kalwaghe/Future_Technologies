Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the hypothetical ability of an intelligent agent to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. It is a primary goal of some artificial intelligence research and a common topic in science fiction and futures studies. AGI can also be referred to as strong AI, full AI, or general intelligent action (Although academic sources reserve the term "strong AI" for computer programs that experience sentience or consciousness.)

In contrast to strong AI, weak AI[7] or "narrow AI" is not intended to have general cognitive abilities; rather, weak AI is any program that is designed to solve exactly one problem. (Academic sources reserve "weak AI" for programs that do not experience consciousness or have a mind in the same sense people do.)

As of 2017, over forty organizations are actively researching AGI, and the arrival of AGI is expected to be decades away.
