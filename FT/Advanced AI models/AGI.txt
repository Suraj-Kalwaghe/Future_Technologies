Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the hypothetical ability of an intelligent agent to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can.[1] It is a primary goal of some artificial intelligence research and a common topic in science fiction and futures studies. AGI can also be referred to as strong AI,[2][3][4] full AI,[5] or general intelligent action[6] (Although academic sources reserve the term "strong AI" for computer programs that experience sentience or consciousness.)[a]

In contrast to strong AI, weak AI[7] or "narrow AI"[3] is not intended to have general cognitive abilities; rather, weak AI is any program that is designed to solve exactly one problem. (Academic sources reserve "weak AI" for programs that do not experience consciousness or have a mind in the same sense people do.)[a]

As of 2017, over forty organizations are actively researching AGI,[8] and the arrival of AGI is expected to be decades away.[9][10]
